# Roadmap

## Next (short term)
- Fix known card logic bug (post-refactor, small PR)
- Add basic 2-player scoring + match history (if not already)

## Later
- AI opponent difficulties
- Monte Carlo odds hover + caching
- Solver / self-play experiments
- UI polish (PokerNews-inspired layout refinements)
